title: What Limits the Emergence of Super AI?
---
I thought that I would switch up the mood from technical to theoretical. The question is, what's impeding the emergence of 
Super AIs - in other words, why don't we have extremely intelligent AIs like HAL 9000 from _2001: A Space Odyssey_, or
Cortana from _Halo_, ones that can assist us in our daily lives and have the potential to learn almost anything. This is my
take on it.

To me, the answer has two parts: firstly, there are algorithmic limitations, and secondly there are architectural limitations.
