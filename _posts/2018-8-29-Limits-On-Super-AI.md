title: What Limits the Emergence of Super AI?
---
I thought that I would switch up the mood from technical to theoretical. The question is, what's impeding the emergence of 
Super AIs - in other words, why don't we have extremely intelligent AIs like HAL 9000 from _2001: A Space Odyssey_, or
Cortana from _Halo_ - ones that can assist us in our daily lives and have the potential to learn almost anything. This is my
take on it.

For me, the answer has two parts: there are algorithmic and there are architectural limitations.

###The Algorithmic Issue
---------------------------
Currently, the state-of-the-art algorithms use something called (deep) ***reinforcement learning***. In short, this type of algorithm follows the way a human or animal would learn something - by trying out an action, recieving either positive or negative feedback, adjusting, and then trying again. This was most famously demonstrated by OpenAI and it showed the ability of an AI to replicate or even surpass a human's ability at certain arcade games. However, as successful as deep reinforcement learning has been, there is a serious limitation
